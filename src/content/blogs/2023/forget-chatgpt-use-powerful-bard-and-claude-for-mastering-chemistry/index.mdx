## ChatGPT: Sid the sloth

ChatGPT, developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/), gained significant attention upon its market release in December 2022, primarily due to its natural language processing capabilities and ability to generate human-like responses. However, despite its initial success, ChatGPT faces significant limitations when you want to use it for free. And if you are a student, most likely you'll not try to waste $20/month if there are better free alternatives. These limitations can be attributed to factors such as slow response times, outdated knowledge, lack of external references, and the absence of visual aids like structures and equations. These challenges are particularly evident in the free version of ChatGPT, making it less suitable for comprehensive chemistry education.

### Slow Response Time:

One of the primary hindrances with ChatGPT's free version is the slow response time of 10-20 seconds. This delay disrupts the flow of learning and can be frustrating for students seeking immediate answers or explanations. It significantly affects the learning experience in a subject that demands quick comprehension and engagement.

### Outdated Knowledge:

Another major limitation of ChatGPT is its reliance on pre-2021 data. Chemistry is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field, with constant advancements and discoveries. By being limited to outdated information, ChatGPT may provide inaccurate or incomplete explanations for recent developments in chemistry.

### Lack of External References:

Although with the help of a Chrome extension, [WebChatGPT](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webchatgpt-chatgpt-with-i/lpfemeioodjbpieminkklglpmhlngfcn), ChatGPT can browse the internet. But, the most of the time the references are either not that relevant or completely wrong in compared to the details provided by a similar free competitor, _Bard_.

### Absence of Visual Aids:

Visual aids, such as molecular structures, chemical equations, and diagrams, play a vital role in understanding complex chemistry concepts. Unfortunately, ChatGPT's free version lacks support for visuals, making it challenging for users to comprehend certain topics that heavily rely on graphical representations. Without access to visual aids, students may struggle to grasp spatial relationships, molecular geometries, and reaction mechanisms, impeding their overall understanding of chemistry.

### Word Limit:

As of now with the free model of ChatGPT, approximately 4000 words (not documented on OpenAI website) can be generated at once. Whereas, with Claude2, you can generate approximately 75000 words at once.

<span class="coloredHeading">**Bard's Reply:** (copy-pasted here)</span>
<br></br>
The molecule in the image is naphthalene. It is a white, crystalline solid with a
characteristic mothball odor. Naphthalene is a hydrocarbon, meaning it is made up
of only hydrogen and carbon atoms. It has a molecular formula of C10H8.

Naphthalene is a relatively simple molecule, but it has some interesting properties. It is a very flammable solid, and it can be used as a fuel. Naphthalene is also an effective insect repellent, and it is often used in mothballs.

Here are some other properties of naphthalene:

‚Ä¢ Melting point: 80.1¬∞C (176.2¬∞F)<br></br>
‚Ä¢ Boiling point: 218¬∞C (424¬∞F)<br></br>
‚Ä¢ Density: 1.14 g/cm3<br></br>
‚Ä¢ Soluble in alcohol, ether, and benzene<br></br>
‚Ä¢ Insoluble in water

Naphthalene is a versatile molecule with a variety of uses. It is a common ingredient in mothballs, and it is also used in the production of nylon and other plastics. Naphthalene is a safe and effective substance when used properly, but it can be harmful if inhaled in large quantities.

üëâ **<span class="coloredHeading">Prompt:</span>**<br></br>
Describe the plot from the image.

<div>
  <div>![Plot](./figures/plot.jpg)</div>
</div>

<span class="coloredHeading">**Bard's Reply:** (copy-pasted here)</span>
<br></br>
Sure, I can help you with that.

The plot from the image shows a chemical reaction that takes place in a reaction coordinate system. The reaction coordinate system is a curve that shows the potential energy of the reactants and the activation energy of the reactants. The potential energy of the reactants is the energy they have before they react. The activation energy is the energy that the reactants need to have in order to react.

The plot shows that the potential energy of the reactants (X + Y-Z) increases as they approach the transition state (activated complex). The transition state is the highest energy point in the reaction. Once the reactants reach the transition state, they have enough energy to react and form the products (X-Y+Z). The potential energy of the products is lower than the potential energy of the reactants, so the reaction is exothermic.

The activation energy for this reaction is represented by the vertical distance between the initial state (reactants) and the transition state. The activation energy is a measure of how difficult it is for the reactants to react. A higher activation energy means that the reactants need more energy to react.

The plot also shows that the reaction is not spontaneous. This means that the reactants will not react on their own. They need to be given some energy in order to reach the transition state and react. This energy can be provided by heat, light, or a catalyst.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
