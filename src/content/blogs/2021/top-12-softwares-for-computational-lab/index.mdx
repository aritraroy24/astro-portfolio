_<span style="font-size:30px;">T</span>he recent advancement in technologies in the last ten years has opened a new era in computational studies. Many misunderstood theoretical studies with computational‚Äî but there is a conceptual difference between these two. Mathematical descriptions and studies about the topic mainly define the former. In contrast, the latter is the study when a computer is well trained to do all types of theoretical calculations and analyses itself upon giving it the instructions. Having robust systems in hand makes it much easier to do computational calculations before doing any experimental work. But what are the softwares to start with? Well, it depends on what type of research work you are doing or going to do. Here, I‚Äôll discuss some most familiar softwares (both open-source and commercial) in this computational research field. So, no more introduction ‚Äî let‚Äôs get into the central part._

## Molecular Docking & Dynamics
#### AutoDock Vina:

[AutoDock Vina](http://vina.scripps.edu/) is an open-source program for doing atomic docking. It was planned and carried out by Dr. [Oleg Trott](http://www.olegtrott.com/) in the Molecular Graphics Lab at The Scripps Research Institute. AutoDock Vina automatically calculates the grid maps and clusters the results in a way transparent to the user.

AutoDock Vina achieves approximately two orders of magnitude speed-up compared to the molecular docking software previously developed in their lab ([AutoDock 4](http://autodock.scripps.edu/)) while also significantly improving the accuracy of the binding mode predictions, judging by our tests on the training set used in AutoDock 4 development. You can use AutoDock Vina free from their site, [vina.scripps.edu](http://vina.scripps.edu/download.html) free for academic purposes.

## Quantum Chemistry
#### Gaussian:

<div><div>

<sup>Gaussian Logo</sup>

</div></div>

Gaussian is a broadly helpful computational science programming bundle at first delivered in 1970 by [John Pople](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Pople) and his examination bunch at Carnegie Mellon University as Gaussian 70. It has been constantly refreshed from that point forward. The latest version is Gaussian 16, and it is now authorized by [Gaussian.inc](https://gaussian.com/contact/). The name begins from Pople‚Äôs utilization of Gaussian orbitals to accelerate sub-atomic electronic construction computations rather than utilizing Slater-type orbitals, a decision made to further develop execution on the restricted figuring limits of then-current PC equipment for Hartree‚ÄìFock estimations. However, it is commercial software, and you can buy the license from the [Gaussian website](http://gaussian.com/gaussian16/). Gaussian 16 can also be run using their GUI-based software [GaussView](https://gaussian.com/gaussview6/).
