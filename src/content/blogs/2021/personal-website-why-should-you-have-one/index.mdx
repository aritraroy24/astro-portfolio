‚ÄúCreate a link through which you can market your dream products. Create a blog or a website of your own depending on what you want to be recognized for. Share your experiences through these media.‚Äù

_<span style="font-size:30px;">I</span>f you have a website, you may not have a good reason to update it. But if you don‚Äôt have a website, you may be missing the boat. You can easily create content and drive traffic to a website when you have a website. You can also use it to showcase your portfolio, communicate with your clients and get more significant jobs._

## Why Should You Have One?
Your personal website is a great way to showcase your skills, experience, and interests. It is also an excellent way for potential employers to find you. People who have a personal website:

[1]. Are more likely to have a job.<br></br>
[2]. Can get promoted earlier and faster.<br></br>
[3]. Are more likely to be hired than people without a website.

Individuals are visual, so the more you can show (instead of telling), the better. Your resume might say that you ‚Äúassembled an organization blog following of 15,000 drew in perusers,‚Äù however, with your own webpage, you can take somebody directly to the blog and show why it‚Äôs so captivating and what separates your work. By highlighting work tests, destinations you‚Äôve chipped away at, articles you‚Äôve composed, whatever, your own landing page can go about as a computerized arrangement of your internet-based work and character. A personal homepage is a possibility to offer individuals more data about themselves, in a more compelling way, than what you can expect to state in your resume.

What? You are going to have a research career, not a job? So, what? You can always showcase your previous projects and papers on your website. It will always help you to collaborate with your fellow researchers.

## How to Build a Personal Website in an Hour
It is possible to build a personal website in 10 minutes. The first step is to create a website using a free website builder. The website builder will provide templates for different websites, such as blogs, portfolios, and e-commerce sites. Once the template is chosen, it will automatically populate its content. Next, the content needs to be edited and updated to reflect users‚Äô personal preferences. Finally, you can add a custom domain name and use free hosting service to complete the site.

Here are a few personal website building website lists -

## What to Put on a Personal Website?
A personal website is a web page created by an individual and typically contains information about themselves. The page typically includes a bio, work experience, and contact information. It‚Äôs essential to make sure that the website‚Äôs information is accurate and up-to-date. You can add a portfolio of your best work, links to your social media pages and contact information. If possible, it‚Äôs also a good idea to add pictures that show off your personality. You can call the website an online version of your CV. Many people have asked me how to start a personal website. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, here are some best practices that you can follow.

1: Make sure that your website is mobile-friendly.

2: Use a platform that allows you to create a website easily and quickly.

3: Make sure that the website looks professional.

4: Make sure that the website loads fast.

## A Cooler Template Just for You
Consider the following template, which is modern and absolutely free ‚Äî

<sup>**Figure 1.1:** Template by [Tim Baker](https://github.com/tbakerx)</sup>

</div></div>

Tim Baker originally created the website. But I have modified it to include more components and configured the contact form to work‚Äîall you need to do some changes and deploy your website on [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/). Follow the following steps to get this excellent template ‚Äî

#### Step 1: Download the Template
Go to the link to download the code ‚Äî [**Download Link**](https://github.com/aritraroy24/Portfolio_V1)

Click on the Code button in Green colour in Figure-2.1 and download the code as a ZIP file (Figure-2.2) ‚Äî

</div></div>

<div><div>

![Download as ZIP file](./figures/download-as-zip-file.webp)

<sup>**Figure 2.2:** Download as ZIP file</sup>

</div></div>

#### Step 2: Setting Up the Environment
- ‚Ä¢ **Extract the ZIP-File:**<br></br>
Extract the ZIP-File to a suitable location on your computer and navigate inside the folder.

- ‚Ä¢ **Download and Install Visual Studio Code:**<br></br>
Download VS Code from the following link for your device and install.
https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

- ‚Ä¢ **Open Downloaded Code in VS Code:**<br></br>
Run Visual Studio Code. Select the folder in which you have previously extracted the downloaded code using the Open Folder option of VS Code (Figure-3.1), and you‚Äôll be able to see a window like Figure-3.2 ‚Äî

npm install

- ‚Ä¢ **Start Your Environment Locally:**<br></br>
In the same terminal, give the following command to start a local server to see the changes locally. You can visit your website (and also all changes) locally at http://localhost:3000.
npm start

#### Step 3: Make Necessary Changes
- ‚Ä¢ **Replace Images/Fonts:**<br></br>
Replace the images, and fonts if you like, with your own. All you have to do is replace the photos at **public/images/header-background.jpg**, **public/images/testimonials-bg.jpg** and **public/favicon.ico** with your own. YOU MUST KEEP THE SAME NAMES ON THE IMAGES.

- ‚Ä¢ **Fill In Your Personal Info:**<br></br>
To populate the website with all of your own data, open the **public/resumeData.json** file and simply replace the data in there with your own. Images for the portfolio section should be put in the **public/images/portfolio** folder.

#### Step 4: Configure the Form:
To configure the form we will be using Formspree to ease our work (Free plan provides 50 form submissions/month). Here are the steps you have to follow to configure your own form ‚Äî
