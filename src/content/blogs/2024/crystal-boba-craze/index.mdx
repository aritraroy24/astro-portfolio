_<span style="font-size:30px;">A</span>ubble tea, also known as boba tea, has taken the world by storm in recent years. The latest bubble tea trend combines two major consumer favourites — boba and crystals. The result? Crystal boba. These small, translucent crystal-shaped boba are taking over social media and bubble tea shops. But what exactly is crystal boba, what makes them so unique, and definitely what’s the chemistry behind it? Let’s find out —_

<p class="sectionDivider">⁕ ⁕ ⁕</p>

## What is Crystal Boba?

Crystal boba is a new form of the tapioca pearls or “bubbles” commonly used in bubble tea. While regular boba pearls are dark-coloured and made from tapioca starch, crystal boba pearls are clear or translucent, resembling shiny little crystals. They are also made from tapioca starch but go through an extra process to achieve a transparent, gem-like appearance. This gives them their crystal-like aesthetic that looks beautiful in colourful bubble tea drinks.

Despite the different appearance, crystal boba has a similar chewy, gummy texture to traditional boba. The fun thing about crystal boba is watching the colours of the tea or fruit juices you pair them with shining through the clear pearls. It takes your bubble tea to a whole new visually pleasing level!

## Crystal Boba versus Normal Boba

So what sets crystal boba apart from standard boba pearls? There are a few key differences:

**Appearance:** Crystal boba pearls are transparent and glossy like crystals while normal boba are opaque and dark in color. This allows crystal boba to showcase the colours of the drinks they’re paired with.

**Texture:** Both varieties have a chewy, gummy texture when you bite them. Crystal boba is a bit firmer compared to normal boba but still delivers that classic tapioca bubble burst.

**Ingredients:** They have the same main ingredient — tapioca starch. However, crystal boba goes through extra processing with enzymes to break down starch molecules and achieve the see-through look.

**Trend Factor:** Crystal boba is the hot new boba on the block. Its photogenic qualities and “gone viral” social media status make it a trendy bubble tea topping. Classic black boba pearls are the OG bubble tea pearls.

**Price:** Due to the extra production steps, most shops charge slightly more for drinks with crystal boba, but they make up for it with their dazzling, made-for-Instagram appearance!

## The Chemistry Behind Crystal Boba

What makes crystal boba transparent while normal boba pearls are opaque? It comes down to chemistry…

Tapioca starch consists of two molecules — amylose and amylopectin. Amylose molecules linearly arrange themselves, which allows them to strongly interact and scatter light. This gives regular boba its cloudy, opaque appearance.

To make crystal boba, an extra step treats the tapioca starch with enzymes that help break down the amylose molecules. With less amylose, the remaining amylopectin and water can be arranged in a more organized matrix that does not scatter light. The result is translucent, crystal-clear boba with fun, jewel-like qualities!

## Is It a Healthier Bubble Tea Option?

Bubble tea is undoubtedly delicious. However, one would be hard-pressed to categorize sugary drinks as the pinnacle of healthy choices. Mass-produced beverages laced with additives and preservatives tend not to make nutritionists’ good books.

That said, in the bubble tea realm, crystal boba constitutes a lighter option compared to the classic tapioca pearls. When considering the health merits from a weight management perspective, crystal boba packs a more petite punch.

Let’s crunch the numbers — 100 grams of sparkling crystal boba contains approximately 70 calories, mostly derived from carbohydrates with barely any fat. Meanwhile, the same portion of traditional boba pearls delivers over 358 calories and a hefty 83 grams of carbs with zero fat. Going by calorie count alone, crystal boba offers a waistline-friendly selection.

Additionally, some individuals with sensitive digestion report tapioca starch sits heavy on the stomach. The molecules in starchy tapioca can be trickier for the digestive tract to break down. Crystal boba made using modified starches may provide easier assimilation for those prone to tummy troubles.

So when debating between regular and crystal boba toppings, the translucent pearls present measurable advantages for health-conscious bubble tea lovers. Crystal boba provides a lighter serving of carbs in a form that may be kinder on delicate digestions. A small win for wellness in the sweet world of boba brews!

## Why Crystal Boba is Trending?

Between their beautiful, glossy appearance and the satisfaction of their chewy bite, it’s no wonder crystal boba is blowing up. Their photogenic qualities make them perfect for Instagram posts, which in turn fuels their popularity. Bubble tea shops have also gotten creative with crystal boba, pairing them with brightly coloured fruit teas. This allows the vibrant hues to shine through the transparent pearls.

On top of their stellar aesthetics, crystal boba also delivers the delightful, chewy texture boba fans know and love. Each gummy pop of crystal boba against your teeth gives you a little burst of joy. Combine this with refreshing fruit tea flavours and you’ve got an irresistible bubble tea experience! Crystal boba takes an already beloved drink to the next level in terms of both taste and visual appeal.

Next time you visit your favourite bubble tea shop, keep an eye out for crystal boba drinks. With their gorgeous looks and fun textures, crystal boba are sure to leave you with a smile!
