## Abstract 
Borophenes, i.e., 2D Boron Sheets, have great potential for future applications like semiconducting properties, hydrogen storage, electrode materials, etc., which makes them fall under the hot topic in the research area. However, though it was first introduced back in 1997 by Ihsan Boustani, and till now, more than 30 structures have been predicted. But unfortunately, all of them are metallic and only stable in ultra-vacuum conditions. Therefore, in my M.Sc. project, I focused on finding a kinetically stable semiconductor Borophene to have full access to the above-mentioned future applications. Though we couldn't find a semiconductor, we found a kinetically stable new Borophene structure.
